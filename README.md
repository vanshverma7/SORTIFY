# SORTIFY

Sortify is a Python script designed to automatically sort and organize files within a specified directory. By categorizing files into predefined folders based on their file types, this utility streamlines the process of managing a cluttered file system.

**Note:** If you are using Windows, use the file named `file_sorter_windows.py`. If you are using macOS or Linux, use the file named `file_sorter_mac.py`.

## Features

- **Automatic Folder Creation:** Creates necessary folders for various file types if they do not already exist.
- **File Categorization:** Moves files into the appropriate folders based on their extensions. Supported categories include:
  - CSV Files
  - Image Files
  - Text Files
  - Excel Files
  - Word Documents
  - PowerPoint Presentations
  - Python Scripts
  - PDFs
  - Audio Files
  - Video Files
  - Web Files
  - Archives
- **Error Handling:** Provides user-friendly error messages if the specified path does not exist.

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Enter the path to the directory containing the files you want to organize.
3. The script will create folders (if they donâ€™t exist) and move the files into the corresponding folders based on their file types.

**Note:** Ensure the provided path is correct and accessible. The script handles various file types and moves them to categorized folders such as 'IMAGE FILES', 'TEXT FILES', 'ARCHIVES', etc.

## Setup

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Save the script as a `.py` file and execute it using a Python interpreter:
    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py
    ```
3. After running, the files in the specified path will be sorted into their respective folders, making file management easier and more organized.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the script to add additional file types or categories as needed.
